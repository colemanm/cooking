Easy, fast, delicious ramen soup with fresh shrimp. This recipe makes 2 batches.

## Ingredients

* 2 packages instant ramen noodles
* 1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped
* 15-20 large raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1/2 cup sliced scallions
* 1/2 cup mirin
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 4 tsp sesame oil
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* Onion straws + fresh basil for garnish
* 12x12" squares of aluminum foil

## Cooking

Preheat oven to 400Â°. Divide the ramen noodle packages evenly across two foil squares, with the bricks centered on the foil. Stack the ingredients on top &mdash; mushrooms, shrimp, onions, scallions, red pepper, salt.

In a bowl, combine the broth, mirin, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and whisk to combine everything.

Bunch the foil up around the outside of your ramen stack, making a pouch around the ingredients. Pour half the liquid into each of your pouches, and press the foil together at the top to make a little chimney for steam to escape. Put your pouches on a cookie sheet or in a casserole dish to catch any drips, in case there are punctures in the foil. Bake for 15 minutes.

We like to take our pouches and pour out into large glass bowls with some fried onion straws for crunch, then garnish with fresh basil.
