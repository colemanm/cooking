![Crack bread](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5548/10697610715_5472dd2de9_z.jpg)

This bread is unreal. Make it.

## Ingredients

* 1 unsliced loaf of sourdough bread
* 8-12 oz cheddar cheese, thinly sliced (or shredded)
* 3 oz bacon bits or chunks, cooked the way you like
* 3/4 cup butter, melted
* 1 tbsp ranch dressing mix (a pouch)

Score the bread in a grid pattern, creating slots to stuff your ingredients. Slice deeply, but not so deep that you cut through the bottom of the crust.

Stuff a healthy (read: unhealthy) amount of cheese and bacon down in the cracks. Put in as much as you think is enough, then put some more. Melt the butter and stir in the ranch mix, then drizzle it down in the cracks evenly, over the cheese and bacon.

Wrap the entire loaf in foil and put on a baking sheet, then bake at 350Â° for 15 minutes. Unwrap it, then bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
